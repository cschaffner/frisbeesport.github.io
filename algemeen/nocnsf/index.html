NOC*NSF
The Nederlandse Frisbee Bond have joined the NOC*NSF (the national sports association). The approving of the membership application was an important moment for the NFB. In the first place it means the recognition of our sport. Apart from recognition, we hope with the support of NOC*NSF and by the possible cooperation with other sports associations to realise a further growth of disc sports in the Netherlands.
Maybe frisbee with its combination of fair play and sportsmanship, can become an inspiration for other sports. Frisbee shows that it is possible to practice sport at a high level without referees.
The NFB attaches great value to this membership.
